# Emscripten
## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning of how to set up and run a cross-platform Emscripten-based C++ project. The main idea is to be able to embed a simple .wasm file and run in the browser.

## Pre-requisites
- Install emsdk from https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git and add it to your PATH (see https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started)
- CMake (https://cmake.org/)
- Clang and Node, which should be included as part of the emsdk, or you can use your own versions if you want to configure them separately.
